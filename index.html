                            <p>I have become such good friends with some of my referrals. It's awesome to make so many warm, likeminded friends just from sharing IIN. My favorite has to be Sonia. We met when I spoke during a workshop at her husband's coffee shop. Her eyes lit up when she heard about IIN. Sonia was a Holistic Dentist in Peru and could no longer practice as a dentist when she moved to this country. She was disheartened by a lot of what she saw going on in our healthcare system and was feeling lost in her job in the dental office where she works. She dreamed of being able to help on a much larger scale but didn't know where to start.</p>

                            <p>IIN was just what she was looking for! She is going to change lives and spread the ripple effect back to her home country! She invited me to go with her and spread our knowledge! We have become good friends who have big goals and dreams!! I am proud to have helped her get her start. </p>

                            <p>My friend Amy and I met through our husbands and bonded over our love for running, healthy living, and having mothers living with Parkinson's disease. Amy was already leading a neighborhood Biggest Loser contest when I suggested she formalize her coaching education at IIN. The school completely resonated with her and she started exactly one year after I did. </p>

                            <p>This fall Amy and I co-lead a group detox, Detox for Team Fox, where 100% of the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research. I think of referring to IIN as sharing an amazing gift. I am so blessed that our experience at IIN has allowed Amy and me to honor our mothers while raising awareness about the importance of eating and living clean and affecting change in the lives of our detox participants.</p>

                            <p>In 2008, I moved from Pennsylvania to accept a middle school teaching job in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The kids I taught were great, but a few months into the job, I knew it wasn't for me. Then I met this great guy and enrolled in IIN the following summer. A couple months into the program, I knew I had found my calling with health coaching AND I knew I had found the guy I would be with for the rest of my life. Mike and I were married in early 2010, and by the end of the year we had our son, Owen.</p>

                            <p>In 2011, I told Mike that he would make a great health coach. He works a full-time corporate job and travels a lot and when he's home, he spends most of his free time with Owen. He wasn't a health nut when I first met him. In fact, the first time he took me out, he brought me to Outback Steak House. I was a vegetarian! I remembered how intrigued he was, listening to all the modules I was working on during my IIN program and how fascinated he was with all the information I was learning about. It was all new to him. He did think about it, enrolled in the next class, and happily graduated from IIN in September 2012. We are a family of health coaches! Thank you IIN!! :)</p>

                            <p>My most rewarding referral was sharing the IIN experience with my mom, Janis Washington White. I shared my excitement with her about all the great things IIN has to offer, including the opportunity for me to redefine my career.</p>

                            <p>She was so impressed that she enrolled to further help the high school students she currently supports as a school counselor as well as diabetics. We were both enrolled in the same class! Although we're close, our relationship is even stronger, especially after attending the IIN LIVE Conference. One day we may even share a coaching practice and ROCK THE RIPPLE together.</p>

                            <p>I met a woman at a company health fair! She was so excited about a nutrition person being there that she came before the health fair even started. She poured her heart out about how food transformed her life. I couldn't help but be in awe  - she had such a powerful story. </p>

                            <p>I said, "Oh my goodness, you could be a health coach." Then I handed her the IIN booklet. She read it cover to cover and even came to a live event one year when we could invite a guest. She enrolled right after. A few months ago, she gave her first talk and I was right by her side! </p>

                            <p>Last year I was profiled in <i>More</i> magazine, and many women enrolled at IIN as a result of it. Many months later, last December, a woman wrote to me. She had been carrying the article around in her handbag for months. It was dog-eared and frayed, but she told me that she'd pull it out and read it regularly, especially when she needed to be inspired.</p>

                            <p>On the very last day of the year, she called IIN and enrolled. She wrote, "If you can do it, I can do it. You inspire me, I joined IIN and I'm on my way to becoming a health coach too!"</p>
